title: A Transfer‐Learning Approach for Accelerated MRI Using Deep Neural Networks
summary: Neural networks have received recent interest for reconstruction of undersampled MR acquisitions. Ideally, network performance should be optimized by drawing the training and testing data from the same domain. In practice, however, large datasets comprising hundreds of subjects scanned under a common protocol are rare. The goal of this study is to introduce a transfer‐learning approach to address the problem of data scarcity in training deep networks for accelerated MRI.
